# Hatlight-ESP32
##### Arduino (ESP32) core of Hatlight

#### This is the code for ESP32 board that controlls the Hatlight

It handles bluetooth, compass, deep sleep, and some other stuff

Hatlight contains 7 addressable LEDs (but code is generally made with that number being flexible) - on the peak, ESP32, LSM303 tilt-compensated compass, and small battery - hidden inside the hat loop
